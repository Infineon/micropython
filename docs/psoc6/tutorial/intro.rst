Getting started with MicroPython on the PSoC6™
==============================================

This tutorial will guide you to get started with running MicroPython on the PSoC6™ microcontrollers. 
There are only a few step keeping you away from enjoy the python programming experience together
with the possibilities of PSoC6™ microcontrollers.
Let's get started!


Requirements
------------

The only required hardware is:

* PSoC6™ board of the :ref:`Supported boards` list.
* A microUSB cable.

Powering the board
------------------

Connect the USB cable to your computer and the micro USB to the board debugger. All the PSoC6™ boards
come with a on-board debugger required for flashing/debugging operations during development. Please refer to the
corresponding board manual of your board.

Install MicroPython
-------------------

In order to simply things, you can run the ``quick-start`` command of the mpy-psoc6 utility. This
will seamlessly take care of the following:

* Install all required software to install MicroPython
* Deploy the latest version of MicroPython PSoC6 firmware on your board
* Launch Arduino Lab MicroPython IDE

Be sure you have the baord at hand. You can already connected to your computer, and then run the
following commands in a terminal:
